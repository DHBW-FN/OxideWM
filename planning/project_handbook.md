# Project handbook

## General project schedule

### Researching technologies
All research results and discussions will be stored in the `concepts` folder.
All documents will be written in markdown - there are no other formal restrictions.

### Ticketing
Every task will be documented with a Git issue.
The current status will be kept updated for the following states:

- TODO
- in progress
- open for review
- done

## Branching
Every issue will get its own branch.
A feature branch will be named after the following guideline:
```
feature/ISSUE<ISSUENUMBER>-<Featurename>
```

A bugfix branch will be named after the following guideline:
```
bug/ISSUE<ISSUENUMBER>-<Featurename>
```

The feature branches can freely be branched for testing purposes.
These sub-branches can be merged back into to top-branch without any pull requests.

Crossbranching between feature branches is prohibited.

Every merge into the `main` branch has to be accepted and reviewed through a pull request.
There should not be any rebase onto `main`.
Working methods on the feature branches are open to developer.

## Testing
All test logs are to be stored in the subdirectory `test_logs`.
Those will not be published on GitHub.
Upcoming issues should be documented with Git-issues with the following format:

````
Titel: error-code

error description

\```
stackstrace
\```

````

### Unittest
Logs from unittests are to be stored in `test_logs/unittests`.
At the end of the project all logs should be pushed to GitHub with one commit.
Unittests can be documented with their source code.
The output has to be logged and saved.

### Manual tests
Manual tests are stored in `test_logs/manual`.
At the end the logs should be commited like the unittest logs.
These logs are formatted like the following:

```markdown
# Testname_Testdate

## Content

... What was tested? ...

## Test results

... Which errors occured, which functions worked? ...
```

## Logging
Logging should work with the following levels:

- info
- trace
- warn

## Scrum

Sprint duration: _1_ week
Sprint-Meeting: _Monday, after the last lecture_
