Introduction
------------
Oxide windowmanager is a dynamic tiling windowmanager for X11. Windows are automatically arranged in a grid-like fashion. The user can then move and resize windows by using keyboard shortcuts. Defining custom keyboard shortcuts to launch applications is possible, too. Oxide tries to maximize the screensize by removing unnecessary borders and decorations as well as to be as keyboard friendly as possible. Everything can be done via the keyboard.

Terminology
-----------
Window: An X11 application window such as a browser or terminal.

Workspace: A workspace contains multiple windows. The user can switch between several workspaces.

Layout: Layouts are different algorithms placing windows.

Config file
-----------
Oxide can be configured via its config file. This includes keybindings, appearance and more. Before editing the global config file located under 

.. code-block:: bash

    /etc/oxide/config.yml

should be copied into the users home directory under 

.. code-block:: bash

    ~/.config/oxide/config.yml

For a more detailed description of the config see oxide-config(1).

-------
Oxide log messages are written to 

.. code-block:: bash
    
        /var/log/syslog
