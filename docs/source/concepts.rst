OxideWM concepts
================

OxideWM is a tiling window manager. This means that windows are automatically arranged in a grid-like fashion. The user can then move and resize windows by using keyboard shortcuts as well as define custom keyboard shortcuts to launch applications.
Customizing

OxideWM is done via a configuration file. The configuration file is written in YAML and can be reloaded at runtime. This makes the user able to change the behavior of OxideWM without having to restart it.

Oxide tries to maximize the screensize by removing unnecessary borders and decorations. It also tries to be as keyboard friendly as possible. This means every user interaction can be done via keyboard.
