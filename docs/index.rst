## Brief Project Description

The goal is to write a X11 dynamic tiling window manager in the rust programming language.
This project idea is inspired by the DWM, leftWM and i3WM. 

## Projected Features

### Fundamental
* starting and quiting applications
* dynamic tiling
* movement of applications
* floating/static applications
* keyboard input handling
* window focusing

### Basic
* multiple workspaces
* multiple monitors
* configuration
* autostarting of applications
* taskbar support
* Drun/Rofi/eww support

### Optional
* ipc
* taskbar
* config file
* power management (screenlocking after timeout)
* animations

## Logging
To change log level, set environment variable `RUST_LOG=[error, info, debug, trace]`.
Logs will always be written to `/var/log/syslog`.
When project is build without `--release` flag, the logs are additionally written to `stdout` and to `log/*.log`.
