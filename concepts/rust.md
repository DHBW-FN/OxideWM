# Rust as implementation language

This document outlines why rust has been chosen as the language of implementation for this project.
But it needs to be mentioned that this choice was not purely made out of technical reasoning, because we think rust is fun and we enjoy to learn this language.

## Technical arguments for Rust

Rust is a good choice for a system level language as it allows direct memory acces but also object orientation and offers a memory safe environment.
Further this is achieved without a resource intensive garbage collection and high speeds in the realm of C are possible.
Even though rust is still "relatively" new, it already has a stable ecosystem and a lot of libraries supporting it.

A first search for rust libraries allowing connections to the X-Server shows multiple results. The same is true for dbus- and IPC-libraries. 

Therefore Rust seems to be a good choice for our project.
