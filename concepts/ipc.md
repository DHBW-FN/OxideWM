# Concept IPC

## Description

An IPC mechanism for the window manager is required.
This is neccessary for:

* Taskbar
* External libraries
* Command line utility

## Requirements
As for the aforementioned use cases it will not be required to send large amounts of data. 
Only short messages will be exchanged between the clients. Also it is not expected that the ipc performance will have a significant impact on the usability of the system.
Therefore some ipc options such as shared memory and semaphores will not be regarded as these options are not as easy to use and do not offer any significant advantages.

## Research

### Options
There are multiple different ways of implementing ipc on posix systems.

#### FIFO
[Named Pipes Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe)
* Work like normal pipes, but are a permanent file on the system
* Fasted regarded option
* Good library support

#### Unix Sockets
[Unix Domain Sockets Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_Domain_Socket)
* Work like tcp sockets
* Very fast ipc mechanism
* Easy to use and inbuilt library support

#### D-Bus
[D-Bus Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus)
[D-Bus documentation Rust](https://docs.rs/dbus/latest/dbus/)
[D-Bus create from freedesktop.org](https://dbus.pages.freedesktop.org/zbus/)
[D-Bus interface for Rust](https://github.com/diwic/dbus-rs)
* High level ipc mechanism
* Based on unix sockets
* Widely used in projects such as Gnome and KDE
* Offers message queing, tow way communication and is supposed to offer a easy to use interface
* Comparetively slow compared to FIFO or UNIX sockets

### Key Takeaways

[Discussion about ipc on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1235958/ipc-performance-named-pipe-vs-socket)
[Stackoverflow Comparison D-Bus vs Unix Sockets](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33887063/difference-between-dbus-and-other-interprocess-communications-method)
[Practical uses of D-Bus](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/604258/what-is-d-bus-practically-useful-for)

* TCP Sockets are only about 16% slower compared to FIFO
* IPC performance is in most cases not the bottleneck
* Sockets allow for two way communication
* Sockets are more widely supported
* IPC interface should be abstracted, so that the ipc mechanism can be changed in a later stage
* D-Bus should offer a high level, easy to use ipc mechanism


## Conclusion

After a technical discussion with our team, we came to the conclusion that D-Bus is the best fit for our needs.
The performance is deemed non critical in our use case and the ease of use will be benefitial for the project.
None the less, the ipc interface should be created in an abstract manner allowing for a possible replacement of the underlying ipc mechanism.
