# NAME

oxide-config - config

# FILES

**~/.config/oxide/config.yml**
: Home config file

**/etc/oxide/config.yml**
: System config file

# Description

Define the behaviour of oxidewm. You can change style, layout, keybindings and more.
The config file is written using YAML syntax.
If the home config file is not existing, default values will be used but commands like `exec` and `exec_always` will not be working.

# KEYBINDING

## KEYS

The keys need at least one MODIFIER and one normal key such as 't'

### MODIFIER

**M**
: Meta key

**A**
: ALT key

**C**
: CONTROL key

**S**
: SHIFT key

### COMMANDS

Commands consist of a command and optional arguments.

: Move Focus

Quit
: Quit the window manager

Kill
: Kill the currently focused window

Restart
: Reloads the config and restarts components

Layout **args** [LAYOUT]
: Change the current layout

GoToWorkspace **args** [WORKSPACE_ARGS]
: Change the current workspace

MoveToWorkspace **args** [WORKSPACE_ARGS]
: Move the used window to a different workspace

MoveToWorkspaceAndFollow **args** [WORKSPACE_ARGS]
: Move the focused window to and select a different workspace

Exec **args** <COMMAND>

## ARGS

### MOVEMENT:

Left
: Moves to the left

right
: Moves to the right

: windows vertically next to each other

HorizontalStriped
: windows a horizontally underneath each other

## WORKSPACE_ARGS

Next

## ITERATIONS

## EXAMPLES

TODO: DEFAULT BINDINGS AND SAMPLE CONFIG

### KEYBINDINGS

```yaml
cmds:
  - keys: ["M", "t"]
    commands:
      - command: Exec
        args: "firefox"
```

### ITERATIONS

```yaml
iter_cmds:
  - iter: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    command:
      keys: ["A", "C", "$VAR"]
      commands:
        - command: GoToWorkspace
          args: "$VAR"
```

In this example using the ALT and CONTROLL key paired with a number from one to nine, the user can go to the desired workspace.
`$VAR` is a reference for the entered iterator.
