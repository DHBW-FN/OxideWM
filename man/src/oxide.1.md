# NAME
Oxide - a dynamic tiling window manager written in rust

# SYNOPSIS
**Oxide** 

# DESCRIPTION
## INTRODUCTION
Oxide windowmanager is a dynamic tiling windowmanager for X11.
Windows are automatically arranged in a grid-like fashion.
The user can then move and resize windows by using keyboard shortcuts.
Defining custom keyboard shortcuts to launch applications is possible, too.
Oxide tries to maximize the screensize by removing unnecessary borders
and decorations as well as to be as keyboard friendly as possible.
Everything can be done via the keyboard.

## TERMINOLIGY 
**Window**
