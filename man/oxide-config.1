.SH NAME
.PP
oxide-config - config
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Define the behaviour of oxidewm.
You can change style, layout, keybindings and more.
The config file is written using YAML syntax.
If the home config file is not existing, default values will be used but
commands like \f[V]exec\f[R] and \f[V]exec_always\f[R] will not be
working.
.SH FILES
.PP
When starting, Oxide has two paths it searches for config files.
.TP
\f[B]\[ti]/.config/oxide/config.yml\f[R]
Home config file
.TP
\f[B]/etc/oxide/config.yml\f[R]

.SH KEYBINDING

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS KEYBINDINGS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
cmds:
  - keys: [\[dq]M\[dq], \[dq]t\[dq]]
    commands:
      - command: Exec
        args: \[dq]firefox\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In this example pressing the meta key and `t', a new firefox window is
opened.
.SS ITERATIONS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
iter_cmds:
  - iter: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    command:
      keys: [\[dq]M\[dq], \[dq]C\[dq], \[dq]$VAR\[dq]]
      commands:
        - command: GoToWorkspace
          args: \[dq]$VAR\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In this example using the ALT and CONTROLL key paired with a number from
one to nine, the user can go to the desired workspace.
\f[V]$VAR\f[R] is a reference for the entered iterator.
